## WordPress Developer's professional portfolio site

Hello all, who interests my portfolio! My name is Aliona. I live in Russia, city Omsk. I work in web development about 8 years, of which the experience of html layout is 4 years and 4 years is the practice of creating sites from scratch, on a turnkey basis, which includes the layout of the site on a `PSD` layout for `CMS WordPress` (content management system), customization for the purpose of the site, optimizing the speed of the site. I develop the sites of various subjects (business sites, web-shops, Landing Pages, etc.), as well as engaged in the `Html`-page layout with connection `Javascript` and `jQuery` libraries.

I have skills in such technologies as `PHP` + `MySQL`, `AJAX`, `CSS`, `SASS`, `HTML5`, `JavaScript`. I also have an experience with most modern frameworks and libraries — `CMS WordPress` (including its `API`), `Bootstrap`, `Foundation`, `jQuery` and many different `JavaScript` and `jQuery` libraries. Words like `Gulp`, `Webpack`, and `Git` don’t scare me.

I strive to expand accumulated knowledge, learning for new technologies and apply it in developing high-quality websites and `WordPress` plugins.
